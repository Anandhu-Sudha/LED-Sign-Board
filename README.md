I must say LED is the only thing that got me into electronics, everything started from there.

Coming to this, This is a cut-out of the Letters 'ECE' ( btw ECE stands for Electronics & Communication Engineering ) accented with LED strips with custom stroke patterns built for the party hall for Christmas celebration. 

Every year we came up with something different and this it time it's this. 

Each letter has red and white LEDs, each segments in a letter can be controlled individually. So it has a total of 6 channels, Used Relay modules to build this since the LED strips required 12v. This relay modules are connected to Arduino and some patterns are coded. (I was not aware about chatGPT at that time, so had to manually code all the patterns using digitalWrite high and low a hundred times).

That's pretty much it. Some videos and pictures are below

All the effort for this... People always asked me why put so much work into things like this that won't even probably get noticed. 

This is my entertainment...
